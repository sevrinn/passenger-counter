# Passenger Counter
Made this little counter tool from vanilla javascript, html, and css.

It's basically two functions. When the increment button is clicked, the increment function is called which increments the count by one and renders the change in the counter number displayed. 
When the save button is clicked, the save function concatenates the current count to the end of the previous counts string, rendering it to the page. Finally, the save function zeros out/ the counter is reset.

Styled with basic css and flexbox.
